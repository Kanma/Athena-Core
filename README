---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Core is the base module of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++.

The classes contained in that module are used by nearly all the other modules.

This module can be used as a standalone library, or combined with the rest of
the Athena Game Framework (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Framework).

Additionally, when the Athena-Scripting (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Scripting)
module is built alongside this one, Athena-Core will be usable from JavaScript.


---------------------------------------
- Dependencies
---------------------------------------

Athena-Core requires the following dependencies:

   - XMake
   - Athena-Math
   - UnitTest++

They are provided as GIT submodules of this repository and will be compiled
automatically during the compilation of Athena-Core.

To download them, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Core>
    Athena-Core$ git submodule init
    Athena-Core$ git submodule update


---------------------------------------
- Compilation
---------------------------------------

(Note: you'll need to install CMake to compile Athena-Core)

To compile Athena-Core (and all its dependencies), do:

    somewhere$ mkdir build
    somewhere$ cd build
    build$ cmake <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Core>
    build$ make

The library will be put in build/bin/
